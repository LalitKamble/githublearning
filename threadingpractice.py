# In this program three threads would try to find prime number between 200 to 500 . At the end each thread will print the prime numbers it found.
#
# 1.	There is an integer variable â€˜countâ€™ with value 200.
# 2.	There are three threads Thread1, Thread2 and Thread3.
# 3.	Each thread either increments or decrements the count by some amount as shown below.
# a.	Thread1 increments or decrements count by 1
# b.	Thread2 increments or decrements count by 2
# c.	Thread3 increments or decrements count by 3
# 4.	Each thread updates count as per below rules.
# a.	Thread1 increments count by 1 if count is even and decrements count by 1 if count is odd.
# b.	Thread2 increments count by 2 if count is even and decrements count by 2 if count is odd.
# c.	Thread3 increments count by 3 if count is even and decrements count by 3 if count is odd.
# 5.	If at any point count becomes greater than 500 program stops.
# 6.	If by incrementing or decrementing count, it becomes a prime number, then the thread which made it prime records it.
# 7.	At the end of program each thread should print the number of prime numbers it found.
